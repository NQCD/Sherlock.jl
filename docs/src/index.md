# ClusterScripts.jl

This package contains functions to more efficiently distribute resources to MD simulations with `NQCDynamics.jl` on HPC clusters, including the ability to initialise simulations with all possible combinations of multiple variables.
This can be useful to compare results across a range of initial parameters, or with a range of different models.

While NQCDynamics.jl provides the tools necessary to run ensemble simulations, and a means of parallelisation through SciML’s EnsembleAlgorithms, compatibility of different models with certain EnsembleAlgorithms isn’t guaranteed, nor will there necessarily be a notable gain in performance.

Since many machine learning interatomic potentials are developed in Python, where the global interpreter lock prevents multithreading, thread parallelism provided by EnsembleAlgorithms tends not to work at all.

This leaves trivial taskfarming as the most viable option to parallelise the execution of multiple simulations across multiple HPC nodes.

This package allows for the creation and aggregation of results for [Single Instruction, multiple data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) workflows on HPC clusters.

## Parameter grid searches

`ClusterScripts.jl` contains functions to generate a "queue" of simulation parameters containing all possible combinations of multiple variables in a simulation.
This allows for grid searches over multiple parameters, which could be used to compare e.g. different interatomic potentials over a range of different temperatures.
